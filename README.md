## Anthony Ridding - Transforming Data into Action


## Introduction
I feel extremely grateful to be alive at this particular time and you should too. The digital explosion of data has created an abundance of data, which spell out the objective functioning of all organizations. There are new problem for businesses to tackle, new insights to gather and extracting the 'needles from the haystack' has become increasingly important.  


## **My Journey to Data Science**

#### **Health Data Analyst**
It started off with an incredible internship working on the [Health Neighbourhoods Project of Durham Region in 2014](https://www.durham.ca/en/health-and-wellness/health-neighbourhoods.aspx) led by two amazing mentors and Epidemiologists, Mary-Anne Pietrusiak and Janet Phillips. 

> Durham Region has 50 Health Neighbourhoods. We present more than 80 indicators, by neighbourhood and municipality, to tell us about the demographics and health of our communities.


#### **Solutions Consultant / Business Analyst**
The amazing team at [360insights](https://360insights.com/) both widened, and deepened my proficiency in the business development, analysis and data wrangling skills. Working directly with the CFO and President, taught me the fundamentals of leadership, executive communication and 'top-down' thinking.
