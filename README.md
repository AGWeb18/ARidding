| Project | <div style="width:100px">Description</div>  | Technology Used |
|-|-|-|
| Instructor \| Durham College | Course focused on the practical implementation of the ETL process from end-to-end. We cover topics such as data types, set up a local database and extract insights from raw data. | *Technology Covered* <br><li>SQL, Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy, pymysql) <br><li>MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench <br><li>Visualization Tools (Power BI) |
| COVID-19 Impact Dashboard \| Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College | A collaborative effort between Human Resources, Student Services, the Incident command team and myself to build a real-time dashboard of the impacts of COVID-19 across the institution. This helps manage all reported cases and acts as a single view into how COVID is impacting the institution.  | *Technology Used* <br><li>Input: Microsoft Forms <br><li>Logic Layer: Power Automate <br><li>Output: Power BI |
| Clinical Activity Dashboard \| CMCC | This dashboard informs the Clinic Management Team of all the experiences across their 7 clinic system. This information is useful for numerous purposes whether it be for managing student experiences or reporting to the board or supporting clinical success.  | *Technology used* <br><li>SQL Server Management Studio, T-SQL <br><li>Python <br><li>pandas, pygsheets |
| PPE Inventory App \| CMCC | A tool used to view current inventory, order more supplies and report the history of each PPE item through a PowerApp embedded in Teams. | *Technology used* <br><li>Microsoft PowerApps integration with Teams <br><li>Microsoft Sharepoint <br><li>Microsoft PowerBI |
| Twitch Streamer Analytics  | Developed some of the early data mining scripts based on the Twitch API that involves a scheduled data extraction , retreiving and analyzing collected data and presenting the results in a visualization for consumer use. | *Technology Used* <br><li>AWS RDS & EC2 Server (Hosting Script, running Cron Job) <br><li>Python/pandas/SQL stack <br><li>Cloud server management |
| Sentiment Analysis on Student Feedback \| Google Cloud | Every year, CMCC sends out an anonymous 'Exit Interview' to the graduating class to gather feedback, extract trends among the responses and use the trends to improve the experience each year. This presents an ideal problem for Natural Language Processesing to build 'themes' for as we have a dataset of open-text and the need to extract insights about it. | *Technology used* <br><li>Python, pandas <br><li>Google Cloud Natural Language API |
