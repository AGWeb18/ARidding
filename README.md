##  Experience

Below is a list of projects that showcase some of tools I commonly use. 

---

**Instructor for: [Data Analytic Tools for Business Decision Making](/course.md)**

This course focuses on the practical implementation of the ETL process from end-to-end. We cover topics such as data types, set up a local database and extract insights from raw data.


*Technology Covered*
- SQL, Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy, pymysql)
- MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench
- Visualization Tools (Power BI)

## **CMCC - COVID-19 Impact Dashboard**

A collaborative effort between Human Resources, Student Services, the Incident command team and myself to build a real-time dashboard of the impacts of COVID-19 across the institution. This helps manage all reported cases and acts as a single view into how the institution is doing. 

_Technology Used_
- Input: Microsoft Forms
- Logic Layer: Power Automate
- Output: Power BI

## **Clinical Activity Dashboard** - **[PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)**

One of the tools I am most proud of building is the Clinical Activity Dashboard. This dashboard informs the Clinic Management Team of all the experiences across their 7 clinic system. This information is useful for numerous purposes whether it be for managing student experiences or reporting how well a specific clinic is doing to the board. 

_Technology used_
- SQL Server Management Studio, T-SQL
- Python
- pandas, pygsheets

## **PPE Inventory App** - **[PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/) | [Sharepoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration)**

A tool used to view current inventory, order more supplies and report the history of each PPE item through a PowerApp embedded in Teams.

_Technology used_
- Microsoft PowerApps integration with Teams
- Microsoft Sharepoint
- Microsoft PowerBI

## **Twitch Streamer Analytics** - **[Famerly](https://www.famerly.com/)**

A passion project that involves a scheduled data extraction from an API, retreiving and analyzing collected data and presenting the results in an easy-to-consume visualization. 


_Technology Used_
- AWS RDS & EC2 Server
- Python/pandas/SQL stack
- Cloud server management

## **Sentiment Analysis on Student Feedback** - **[GCP NLP API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language)**

Every year, CMCC sends out an anonymous 'Exit Interview' to the graduating class to gather feedback, extract trends among the responses and use the trends to improve the experience each year. This presents an ideal problem for Natural Language Processesing within the domain of Machine Learn to tackle as we have a dataset of open-text and the need to extract insights about it. 

_Technology used_
- Python 
- pandas
- natural language API
- Google Cloud

## **Kaggle Competitions/Machine Learning** - **[Kaggle](https://www.Kaggle.com/)**



> About 80 percent of adults experience low back pain at some point in their lifetimes. It is the most common cause of job-related disability and a leading contributor to missed work days. [-National Institute of Health](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Low-Back-Pain-Fact-Sheet)

Utilizing technology to enhance the lives of people always has, and always be my life's mission. If we could produce a model which accurately predicts low back pain, then perhaps anatomical measurements could be examined more routinely as an indicator of back health.

- [Low Back Pain Algorithm](https://www.kaggle.com/anfro18/lower-back-pain-algorithm) - 85% accuracy with Support Vector Machine

_Technology used_
- Language: Python
- Data Transformation: pandas, numpy
- Machine Learning: keras, scikit-learn
- Visualization: seaborn
