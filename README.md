A passion project that involves the entire data pipeline, from writing a script to collect data, aggregating the collected data into meaningful insights and communicating the results effectively. 




## Introduction
The digital explosion of data has created an abundance of data, which spells out the objective functioning of all organizations. There are new problem for businesses to tackle, new insights to gather and extracting the 'needles from the haystack' has become increasingly important.  




## **My Journey to Data Science**

#### **Health Data Analyst**
It started off with an incredible internship working on the [Health Neighbourhoods Project of Durham Region in 2014](https://www.durham.ca/en/health-and-wellness/health-neighbourhoods.aspx) led by two amazing mentors and Epidemiologists. 

> Durham Region has 50 Health Neighbourhoods. We present more than 80 indicators, by neighbourhood and municipality, to tell us about the demographics and health of our communities.

It was here that I learned the basics of programming through **[Excel VBA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office)** where I built a script to aggregate multiple Excel documents into a single spreadsheet saving weeks worth of work. 


#### **Solutions Consultant / Business Analyst**
The amazing team at [360insights](https://360insights.com/) both widened, and deepened my proficiency in business analysis and data wrangling skills. Working directly with the CFO and President, taught me the fundamentals of leadership, executive communication and 'top-down' thinking.
